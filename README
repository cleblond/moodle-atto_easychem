This is a Moodle 2.7+ chemistry equation and structure editor based on easychem.js.  It is very similar to the Moodle equation editor, but allows you to write/draw chemical equations and structures very easily utilzing the easychem scripting language.  Easychem.js was written by Peter Win (www.easychem.js) and the Moodle Atto plugin/filter combo were written by Carl LeBlond.
